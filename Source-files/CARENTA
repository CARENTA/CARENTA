/* What needs to be done...

 *      of creating a registry for each object and a few hard coded objects
 * 		into the registry in order to create "realism"! Auto generate product/customer numbers!
 * 
 * ->	Functionality of creating an order and everything that is included such as...
 * 
 * 		... auto-generated order numbers.
 * 		... calculation of price and such... (what to about the date calculation?)
 * 		... other storing functionalities.
 * 
 * ->	An order registry! A warehouse registry!
 * 
 * -> 	The entire GUI-system! */
